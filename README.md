# darius_matchup
An application to gain insight over Darius' matchups.

Q: How does this work?

A: This is an application built for Darius mains and people currently playing Darius. It's useful in calculating the total possible damage, any advantage in stats and additional possibly helpful advice. Just adjust the levels, runes and items and find out the best strategy to win your lane. Yes, it only covers the setup and beginning of the game because as in-game time ticks on, the exogenous variables get too complicated to have a 'guide' for. Only general advice is given regarding that. Good luck!

Q: Who are you?

A: Hello, my name is nimbleclouds (IGN: Struggling Dog). I've played this champion for a while now and have collectively 3M MP accumulated. I'm currently Diamond 2. During my run, I've started to realize that this champion (and by proxy, the whole game or at least your chances of increasing your odds at winning) is entirely dependent on early advantage and proper setups. All matchups are winnable and it is POSSIBLE to play at 100% every time. The only reason people make mistakes is because they don't actually realize what they're doing is a mistake, that's all. If we figure out the numbers, winning in lane is basically guaranteed as long as you have the mechanics to back it up.
